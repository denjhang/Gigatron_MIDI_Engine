# Gigatron_MIDI_Engine
The Gigatron MIDI sound engine, written in gtbasic, supports simple macro-defined instruments. It converts MIDI to a `sound_on` function command stream; while this method is generally inefficient, it allows you to easily control four audio channels to emit sound simultaneously and enables various sound effects.
